### v0.2.7 🚀 Major update of the "Pollen Forecast BETA" sensor!
After its beta period, the forecast sensor is heading for a stable release—bringing more accuracy, data and possibilities for your dashboards.

- 🔄 **Re-worked algorithms in "Pollen Forecast BETA"**  
  - The `state` now reflects the **current** pollen index from the *now* block, not the first hourly step.  
  - Hourly forecasts aggregate the index and allergen levels by **maximum** within each three-hour window (was median).  
  - Daily and 12-hour values are calculated using an **observational percentile** (no interpolation):  
    ≥ 18 points → 80th percentile · 12–17 points → 70th · < 12 points → maximum.

- 🌸 **Forecast sensor is always created**  
  Sensor `weather.silam_pollen_{Zone Name}_forecast` is present regardless of options—*now* data are always available; **hourly**, **twice-daily (12 h)** and **daily** forecasts appear **only when the forecast option is enabled**.

- 🌅 **Daily forecast & allergen peaks**  
  The sensor now includes a **daily forecast** (up to five days) based on the observational percentile.  
  New attribute `allergen_peaks` reports **peak allergen concentrations** for both daily and twice-daily windows—shown when specific allergens are enabled.

- ➕ **New attributes for "Pollen Forecast BETA"**  
  `next_condition`, `pollen_<allergen>`, `altitude`, `date`, `responsible_elevated`—extra context for automations and dashboards.

- ⏱️ **Diagnostic sensor “Forecast Horizon”**  
  The new `sensor.silam_pollen_{Zone Name}_forecast_horizon` shows how many hours the current forecast (`state`) actually covers and what forecast length (`forecast_duration`) you asked for.

- 🖼️ **Supported in pollenprognos-card v2.4.1+**  
  The card now renders the daily forecast via `weather.get_forecasts`.  
  > **Version compatibility**  
  > • pollenprognos-card ≥ **v2.4.1** requires **silam_pollen ≥ v0.2.7**  
  > • Older card versions (≤ v2.4.0) remain compatible with silam_pollen ≥ v0.2.5.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These new algorithms may affect automations that relied on the old index or allergen-level values. Review your scripts and adjust thresholds or conditions if needed.
