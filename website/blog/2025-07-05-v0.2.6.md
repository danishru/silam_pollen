### v0.2.6

- 🆕 **`native_name` Attribute**  
  All allergen sensors now include a `native_name` attribute that reflects the original SILAM API key (e.g. `alder_m22`, `grass_m32`, etc.), ensuring better compatibility with external tools and visualizations.

- 🔧 **Unified `entity_id` Naming**  
  Entity IDs (including defaults and resets) now correspond exactly to the keys in the localization files. For example, `sensor.silam_pollen_{Zone Name}_grass` remains identical across all languages and for every sensor in the integration.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To revert your entities to the new default names, follow the [device customization guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/) in the Home Assistant documentation.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you’ve already created automations or scripts, remember to update the referenced `entity_id` values.  
> > If your Home Assistant system language is English or Russian, you can ignore this notice — entity IDs will remain unchanged for these languages.
