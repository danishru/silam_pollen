### v0.3.1 🧠 Smarter data updates.

Version v0.3.1 introduces a major internal improvement in how SILAM Pollen **detects and updates forecast data**.

The integration is now **run-aware** and checks the SILAM **runs catalog** before fetching data. This allows it to reliably determine whether a **new model run is actually available**, instead of blindly re-downloading the same dataset.

If the current run hasn’t changed:
- cached data is safely reused,
- full XML downloads are skipped,
- and only genuinely missing forecast hours are fetched when the forecast window moves forward.

This results in:
- significantly fewer unnecessary network requests,
- faster and more predictable updates,
- reduced load on both Home Assistant and the SILAM data infrastructure.

These changes are especially important ahead of the pollen season, ensuring timely updates while keeping the integration efficient and robust.
