### v0.3.0 🚀 One glance — the full picture of weather and pollen.
v0.3.0 delivers a cohesive experience: one card brings together weather and pollen with a familiar look, fast response, and clear presentation. The integration now ships **with the dashboard card included**: a local JS module is bundled — no CDN or external dependencies (you only need to add it once under “Resources”). The Basic panel preserves the simplicity of the stock Weather card, while the Extended panel unfolds all forecast and allergen layers — tidy, informative, and straight to the point.

- 💠 **Experimental Lovelace card (local build)**  
  - Self-contained JS bundle, **no CDN**, works offline.  
  - Built-in visual editor (**LitElement**) — configure right in the UI.  
  - **Live WebSocket updates** — no polling delays.  
  - **Automatic i18n**: language, formats, and units from Home Assistant.  
  - **Native MDI icons** and theme support.  
  - **Compatible with any `weather.*`**, shines with `weather.silam_pollen_*_forecast`.

- 🖼 **Basic panel**  
  - Mirrors the stock Home Assistant Weather card for maximum visual consistency.  
  - For current weather, shows current conditions and **one primary attribute of your choice** — just like the stock card — and additionally lets you select **an unlimited number of draggable** attributes (toggle **row** or **column** layout).  
  - When forecast is enabled for **SILAM**, the **forecast row** shows the **pollen index icon and state** instead of weather condition and temperature; for other weather integrations, behavior is **identical to the stock card**.  
  - Supports a **scrollable list of forecast slots** if they don’t fit horizontally.  
  - **Number of slots** is configurable in the editor: up to **12** via slider or **unlimited** via manual input.  
  - Selecting attributes in the **additional block** unlocks wide possibilities to visualize weather data the way you like.

- 📊 **Extended forecast panel**  
  - Modes: **Standard**, **Focus**, **Minimal**.
  - 🌿 **Allergen-level forecasts**

    - **A dedicated forecast line** for each selected allergen.  
    - **Peak concentrations** highlighted in 12-hour and daily views.  
    - **Show details on tap** on pollen blocks: opens the sensor card for the tapped allergen; behavior is configurable in the editor.  
    - **Trend logic + icon** — clear up/down indication.
  - ⛅ **Full forecast layers**

    - **Temperature** and **apparent temperature**, **precipitation** (probability and amount), **UV index**, **wind** (speed, gust, direction), **cloud coverage**, **humidity**, **dew point**, **pressure**.  
    - **Meteo risk strip (experimental)**: fog (radiation/advection), dew, frost, icing/freezing rain, heavy rain/snow, heat, wind chill, strong/storm wind, “barometric saw”.  
    - Slim strips for **humidity** and **dew point**, clear labels, refined typography.  
    - **Gestures**: **tap** / **hold** / **double tap** (navigate, link, call service, perform action).
