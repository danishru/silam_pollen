### v0.3.2 🧠 Smarter pollen updates for the new season

Version **v0.3.2** strengthens the **SMART update logic**, making pollen forecasts more reliable and easier to use as the new season begins.

With **SMART dataset selection**, SILAM Pollen no longer relies on a fixed configuration.  
Instead, it **automatically chooses the most suitable pollen dataset for your location**, based on actual coverage — helping ensure that the forecast you see is relevant to where you live.

In practice, this means:
- less manual setup and guesswork,
- fewer cases of misleading or irrelevant pollen data,
- smoother behaviour when datasets change between seasons.

Manual dataset selection is still available, but **SMART mode is recommended for everyday use**.

#### 🌍 SILAM pollen v6.1 datasets

This release introduces support for the **latest SILAM pollen v6.1 datasets**, which form the basis for forecasts in the upcoming pollen seasons.

Compared to previous versions, v6.1 datasets provide:
- updated **SILAM v6.1 model outputs** for the current season,
- a refreshed **European baseline** (SILAM Europe pollen v6.1),
- a new **high-detail regional dataset** where available.

- **SILAM Finland pollen v6.1** offers the **highest spatial detail** within its coverage area  
  🟦 **Blue zone** — coverage of **SILAM Finland (v6.1)** with **up to 0.8 km resolution**, especially useful for users in:
  - Finland  
  - Saint Petersburg and Northwestern Russia  
  - Northern & eastern Sweden (including Stockholm)  
  - Northeastern Norway  
  - Northern Estonia (including Tallinn and Narva)

When available, this dataset is **automatically selected by SMART mode**, with manual selection still possible in the integration options.

#### ⚠️ Deprecation

> [!WARNING]  
> 📉 **Pollen Index** sensor is now **legacy** and **disabled by default**.  
> It is removed automatically on update and can be re-enabled via the **legacy toggle** in integration options.
