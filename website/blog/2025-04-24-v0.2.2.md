### v0.2.2

- **⏱️ Forecast duration setting**  
  When creating or modifying an entry, you can now choose the forecast duration from 36 to 120 hours (default is 36 h). As the hours increase, the number of forecast points twice a day increases proportionally.
- **🛠️ Diagnostic sensor “fetch_duration”**  
  A sensor to display the data update execution time (API requests, processing, calculations). Disabled by default.
- **🌐 Added Czech translation**  
  Thanks to [@kasparmir](https://github.com/kasparmir) for the first implementation of the Czech localization!
